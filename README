    Plack::Middleware::CSS::Compressor - Plack middleware to compress
    stylesheets

SYNOPSIS
      use Plack::App::File;
      use Plack::Builder;

      builder {
          mount '/public' => builder {
              enable 'CSS::Compressor';
              Plack::App::File( root => './public' );
          };
          mount '/' => $app;
      };

      # or in a middleware setup

      builder {
          enable 'CSS::Compressor',
              suffix => '.min'
          ;
          enable 'Static',
              path => sub { s!\A /public/ !!x },
              root => './public/'
          ;

          $app;
      };

DESCRIPTION
    This middleware provides the possibility to compress stylesheets on the
    fly.

OPTIONS
    suffix  String or regular expression object that matches a suffix at the
            end of the file. This allows to control compression through the
            file name. To unconditionally enable compression set the suffix
            to an empty string.

SEE ALSO
